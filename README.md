# FlappyBird
A version of Flappy Bird built using SceneKit in swift. This app was built with the support of George Lo and the Purdue iOS Dev Club as a learning mechanism for iOS Development.

I attempted to port the app over to the Apple Watch. It was unsucessful due to the fact that the Apple Watch does not support SpriteKit or SceneKit. Presumably for battery consumption concerns. Maybe future watch iterations they will allow 2D games on their platform?
